# In a real implementation, this would be an actual Python wheel file
# 
# Deep Learning Kit Package v2.0.0
# =================================
# 
# This package contains:
# - Pre-configured TensorFlow/Keras models
# - Neural network architectures (CNN, RNN, LSTM)
# - Transfer learning utilities
# - Model optimization tools
# - Data preprocessing for deep learning
